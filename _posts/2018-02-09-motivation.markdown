I have always harbored a deep respect for coding because it reprented to me the closest mankind has come to developing a representative model of itself. In this vehicle of coding, I see the potential to extend the innate and extraordinary potential of the human mind. Coding allows the mind to replicate itself by automating tasks across a vast scale. Coding can mimic complex operations of the mind, including but not limited to risk analysis, optimization, and predictive forecasting. The applications of software engineering are constantly growing both in size and scope and the demand for people trained in this field will only grow as the future becomes tomorrow and as the world becomes more and more connected.

My decision to become more well versed in the field of coding is my response to the obvious and growing demand for expertise in this field. I'm excited to find out where the journey will take me and I'm thankful for the opportunity to engange with such a strong and diverse community that's as passionate about learning how to code as I am.
