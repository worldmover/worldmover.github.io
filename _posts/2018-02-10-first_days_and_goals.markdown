The first day of learning with the community powered bootcamp was an experience to remember. The structure of the platform is very close to the format of the bootcamp prep course I was previously taking. I love the integrated videos, example based instruction, and the support of the community. I wanted to take some time in this blog post to share a few goals I have for this program. 

Goals and vision:

1) Progress at a steady pace through the lessons => Spend at least 30 hrs. a week engaging with the curriculum and community
2) Make valuable connections within the community and field => Participate in at least 2 of the study groups each month and make a strong effort to follow up with those people I meet with similar goals to my own
3) Keep a motivation board to remind me of the progress I've made and the path ahead => Make weekly updates to my progress board including strategy adjustments to optimize my learning


I'll be adding new posts as I continue to forge ahead and get deeper into the program, but for now I'll end this post with a quick quote I like:

"Whatever you are, be a good one." - Abraham Lincoln
