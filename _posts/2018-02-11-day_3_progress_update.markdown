Today I learned about Ruby methods and arguments. I completed a lab that builds the design of a tic tac toe board. I had a lot of fun moving through the exercises and felt like I really made some good leaps of understanding when it comes to the process of how data is represented in the Ruby language. 

Things I'm looking forward to: Working with the tic tac toe lab, participating in a study group, making a few friends  

Things I'm thankful for: Ability to pursue learning with the help of the platform and community

Things I learned today: Ruby variable and method definitions, how to incorporate arguments into methods, significance of return values.

Time for the quote of the day:

Chieftains must understand that the spirit of the law is greater than its letter. - Attila the Hun
